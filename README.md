# Algo Trading with Dashboard

This project is a backtested algorhytmic trading strategy.  It utilizes a Stochastic Osccillator, Bollinger Bands, and RSI indicators to create a buy or sell signal.  These indicators are useful for pursuing a momentum trading strategy.  The Stochastic Osicillator is based on the current price and the highest and lowest price of the past 14 days.  The Bollinger Bands provide similar momentum signals but they are based on crossing over the two standard deviations from the mean. The RSI or Relative Strength Index formula is based over a 14 period similar to the Stochastic Oscillator, but utilizes the percentage return rather than the price movements. 

## Technologies
This use project uses Python 3.8 and iPython in Jupyter Lab.  Windows 10 is the operating system.

## Libraries Uses
    
    Pandas - used to create dataframes and manipulate data in    dataframes
    Numpy - used to perform calculations on data
    Pathlib - path library used to set filepath
    Os - used to access operating system
    Requests - used to pull API data
    Dotenv - loads environment files
    Alpaca_trade_api - used to get API files from Alpaca
    Matplotlib - used to graphically display data and calculations
    Streamlit - installed as a package to run dashboards
    Plotly - used to create displays for returns 
    

## Installation Guide
This project requires a Python Environment with Python 3.8 and additional installations of alpaca_trade_api and dotenv.  It requires the user to import requests, os, numpy, and pandas.

## Usage

To use this dashboard, navigate to the portion of the code that houses the Alpaca REST API.  In here, change the start and end parameters to your preferred date, the timeframe of stock prices, and the ticker symbol for the stock you wish to analyze.  Run the entire program and once Streamlit has opened a new browser window, hit the run bottom to display the graphs. ALternatively, a CSV can be fed into the program rather than using Alpaca REST API.
